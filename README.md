# blogProject2
My Django blog app is meant to have the following functionalities:

-    A register page (a new user can register, their details stored in a database file). 

-    login (checks in the file and logs them in if they are already registered)

-    reset password

-    logout

-    A comment section, you must be logged in to comment

-    And it's to be hosted on heroku
